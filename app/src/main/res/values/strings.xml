    <string name="tutorial_text_3">In this tutorial, you build a simple UI component with declarative functions. You call Compose functions to say what elements you want and the Compose compiler does the rest. Compose is built around Composable functions. These functions let you define your app\\\'s UI programmatically because they let you describe how it should look and provide data dependencies, rather than focus on the process of the UI\\\'s construction, such as initializing an element and then attaching it to a parent. To create a Composable function, you add the @Composable annotation to the function name.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_text_2">Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.</string>

    <!--30 Days Of Push-Up-->
    <string name="todo1">Do 10 standard push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip1">Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and avoid sagging your hips. This classic push-up is the foundation of upper body strength. Focus on controlled movements and steady breathing to build endurance over time.</string>

    <string name="todo2">Do 12 wide-grip push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip2">Place your hands wider than shoulder-width for extra chest activation. This variation helps target your pectoral muscles more intensely. Keep your elbows slightly bent outward and lower yourself in a slow, controlled motion to maximize muscle engagement.</string>

    <string name="todo3">Do 15 incline push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip3">Use a bench or wall to make it easier and focus on form. Incline push-ups are excellent for beginners and for targeting the lower chest. Ensure your hands are firmly placed, and maintain a straight spine throughout the movement.</string>

    <string name="todo4">Do 10 diamond push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip4">Place your hands close together under your chest for a triceps burn. Diamond push-ups intensify the workload on your triceps and inner chest muscles. Keep your elbows tucked in as you lower your body and push back up smoothly.</string>

    <string name="todo5">Do 20 knee push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip5">A great way to build endurance while maintaining good form. This beginner-friendly variation reduces strain but still strengthens your upper body. Focus on slow, controlled movements and keep your shoulders and hips aligned.</string>

    <string name="todo6">Do 8 slow eccentric push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip6">Lower down for 3 seconds to improve control and strength. By slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase, you increase muscle time under tension. This method is excellent for developing muscle mass and overall control.</string>

    <string name="todo7">Do 6 plyometric push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip7">Push yourself off the ground for extra power. Explosive push-ups improve muscle power and reaction time. Land softly to protect your joints, and engage your core for stability.</string>

    <string name="todo8">Do 10 one-leg push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip8">Keep one leg off the ground to engage your core. This variation challenges your balance and works additional stabilizing muscles. Switch legs halfway through to maintain muscle symmetry.</string>

    <string name="todo9">Do 12 Spiderman push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip9">Bring your knee to your elbow as you lower down. This advanced variation engages the obliques, strengthening your core while improving flexibility and mobility in your hips.</string>

    <string name="todo10">Do 10 shoulder tap push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip10">Tap your shoulder after each rep for extra stability. This move requires balance and control, forcing your core and shoulders to work harder. Keep your hips from twisting as you shift your weight.</string>

    <string name="todo11">Do 12 decline push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip11">Elevate your feet to target upper chest and shoulders. This variation increases difficulty and focuses more on your deltoids and upper pecs. Ensure proper form to prevent shoulder strain.</string>

    <string name="todo12">Do 8 archer push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip12">Shift weight to one arm for increased difficulty. Archer push-ups are a great way to transition to one-arm push-ups. Keep the inactive arm extended and control the movement.</string>

    <string name="todo13">Do 10 Hindu push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip13">Use a full-body motion for flexibility and strength. This dynamic push-up combines strength, mobility, and flexibility. Flow through the movement smoothly to maximize benefits.</string>

    <string name="todo14">Do 5 clapping push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip14">Explosive training for upper body power. Push off the ground with enough force to clap your hands mid-air. Land gently to protect your wrists and elbows.</string>

    <string name="todo15">Do 8 negative push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip15">Lower down slowly for 5 seconds to build endurance. Controlling the descent increases muscle activation and builds strength over time. Focus on smooth, controlled movements.</string>

    <string name="todo16">Do 6 fingertip push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip16">Strengthens fingers and wrists. This advanced variation develops grip strength and forearm endurance. Start with fewer reps and build up gradually.</string>

    <string name="todo17">Do 10 cross-body push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip17">Cross one leg under your body as you lower down. This movement increases core engagement and improves overall stability. Keep your movements fluid and controlled.</string>

    <string name="todo18">Do 12 pike push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip18">Focus on your shoulders and upper chest. The inverted position shifts the workload to your deltoids, making it a great exercise for shoulder development.</string>

    <string name="todo19">Do 6 Superman push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip19">Extend your arms and legs off the ground for extra challenge. This high-intensity variation engages your entire body. Ensure proper warm-up before attempting.</string>

    <string name="todo20">Do 10 uneven push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip20">Place one hand on a block for greater range of motion. This enhances strength in each arm independently, promoting balance and control.</string>

    <string name="todo21">Do 10 side-to-side push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip21">Shift laterally for better control and stability. Moving side-to-side increases chest and shoulder activation, providing a unique challenge.</string>

    <string name="tip24">Move in a swooping motion to engage multiple muscles. This exercise strengthens the shoulders, chest, and lower back while improving flexibility.</string>

    <string name="todo25">Do 8 weighted push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip25">Increase resistance with a backpack or weight plate. Adding weight intensifies the challenge, leading to greater muscle growth.</string>

    <string name="todo26">Do 10 sphinx push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip26">A triceps-focused push-up variation. Keep your elbows close to your body and lower down slowly for maximum effectiveness.</string>

    <string name="todo27">Do 5 isometric hold push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip27">Hold halfway down for 10 seconds to build endurance. This static hold increases time under tension, improving muscle endurance.</string>

    <string name="todo28">Do 12 T-push-ups.</string>
    <string name="tip28">Rotate into a side plank after each push-up. This move strengthens your core and enhances balance and stability.</string>

    <string name="todo29">Do as many push-ups as possible in 1 minute.</string>

        Hi friends,\n\nI was at the grocery store on Sunday night.. when I ran into Genie Williams!
        I almost didn\'t recognize her afer 20 years!\n\nAnyway, it turns out she is on the
        organizing committee for the high school reunion this fall. I don\'t know if you were
        planning on going or not, but she could definitely use our help in trying to track down lots
        of missing alums.\n\nIf you can make it, we\'re doing a little phone-tree party at her place
        next Saturday, hoping that if we can find one person, thee more will…

    <string name="email_4_body">
        Thought we might be able to go over some details about our upcoming vacation.\n\nI\'ve been
        doing a bit of research and have come across a few paces in Northern Brazil that I think we
        should check out. One, the north has some of the most predictable wind on the planet. I\'d
        love to get out on the ocean and kitesurf for a couple of days if we\'re going to be
        anywhere near or around Taiba. I hear it\'s beautiful there and if you\'re up for it, I\'d
        love to go. Other than that, I haven\'t spent too much time looking into places along our
        road trip route. I\'m assuming we can find places to stay and things to do as we drive and
        find places we think look interesting. But… I know you\'re more of a planner, so if you
        have ideas or places in mind, lets jot some ideas down!\n\nMaybe we can jump on the phone
        later today if you have a second.
